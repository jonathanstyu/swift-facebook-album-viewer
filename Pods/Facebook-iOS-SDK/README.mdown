Note about this Fork
--------------------

This fork makes the Facebook SDK for iOS usable with XCode 6.0 beta 3. The beta doesn't work properly if a protocol has the same name as a class. This happens in the Facebook SDK for iOS with the `FBGraphObject` protocol. Check [this discussion in the Developer Forums](https://devforums.apple.com/message/1002106#1002106).

It refactors version `3.16.0` of the Facebook SDK for iOS so that the `FBGraphObject` protocol is now named `FBGraphObjectProtocol`.

To use this workaround, include this in your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Facebook-iOS-SDK', :git => 'https://github.com/pgaspar/facebook-ios-sdk.git'
```

Don't forget to run `pod update Facebook-iOS-SDK` after that.
